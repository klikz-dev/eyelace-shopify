        "description": "<p>Hi I’m Jocelyn Jones, founder of Eyelace LLC.  As a model of many years, I understood the importance of perfect lashes to draw attention to one’s eyes and face. And as a professor and writing instructor in my day job, I wanted to tap into the confidence that lashes gave me in front of a camera but I also wanted a very natural look that I could easily achieve myself. Thus began my rather obsessed pursuit of how to achieve the lash look and experience I wanted. </p><p>Strip lashes didn’t do it for me because I couldn’t depend on them being easy to apply nor staying put when I did manage to get them. But, worse, even at their best strip lashes never looked natural because of the heavy makeup needed to blend in the strip that sat on top of your eye. </p><p>Extensions also weren’t a long term answer. I didn’t like needing to depend on the timing of a professional nor the cost, so I learned how to apply them myself. But that’s when I realized the real cost of extensions was the damage to your natural lashline. Extensions use a strong glue that sits right on your follicles, inhibiting their growth and pulling out your natural lashes when it’s removed. Additionally, I actually had to have a piece of the hard glue removed by my ophthalmologist—twice—once after the glue had already scratched my cornea. </p><p>And though mascara is the easiest lash augmentation to use, ironically, mascara never looks as natural as strips and extensions at their best because natural lashes aren’t chunky, but thin, wispy, and slender. Additionally, mascara either ran on my face or in being water-resistant was also hard to remove and thus irritated the sensitive skin under my eyes when I was cleaning the mascara off.</p><p>My obsession with discovering how to achieve the perfect lash look led me to combine my academic research skills with my passion for natural beauty. I went to work cutting up existing lashes to redesign a new kind of lash. Then a friend who was an engineer helped me contact factories that had the tools capable to help me perfect and manufacture my designs.</p><p>After over two years of testing, refining, and perfecting the designs, my Eyelace collection was born. Eyelace offers users a lightweight, natural-looking lash that can be applied beneath the lash line. Thus Eyelace does not require the heavy makeup of strips. And it delivers the same striking results as extensions without the damage. Eyelace also can’t run or smudge. Matter of fact, when I’m wearing the more subtle designs in the Eyelace collection,  you can’t even tell that I’m adding anything to my lashes at all. So my eyes get all the attention without any of the problems. No more heavy eyeliner, no more frustrating strip lash application—just natural, seamless beauty that I could count on.</p><p>But in many ways, my vision for what my Eyelace could become only began with my creation of the lashes. When I realized I could offer my lash to others, I realized I also had the opportunity to create a platform that could connect empowered women who were similarly committed to augmenting their natural beauty and advancing themselves both professionally and aesthetically. I realized Eyelace could also be a vehicle that created money and collectively redirected it toward empowering women worldwide.</p><p>There are few things about Eyelace that make me happier than knowing a portion of our proceeds will go to the amazing visions of these three organizations: (1) The Malala Fund: Working for a world where every girl can learn and lead. (2) The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence: Voice of victims. Voice for advocates. (3) Working for Women: Creating pathways to economic empowerment.</p><p>I believe it’s my uniquely feminine view of the world that sees all things as connected to all things. At times that leads me to an overcomplicated perspective, but most of the time I think that helps me see the reality of the complexities that exist around me. And it’s that feminine perspective that leads me to desire to create a company in which my investment in myself is also an investment in the betterment of women worldwide. So far this desire has resonated with every woman I’ve shared my sentiments with and gives me the confidence to build a platform in which bold and empowered women connect with and inspire each other.</p>",
